<h1> Design Patterns </h1>

<h3> introduction </h3>

- Pattern has 4 essential elements
  - name  
    - It lets us design software at a higher level of abstraction without looking into specific details of code
    - It's basically what we use to describe design problems, its solution, consequences of using the solution and trade offds
    - helps us to communicate the software problem
  - problem
    - the problem that enables us to look for such design pattern and apply them 
    - there are usually different context of design problems
        - a) how to represent algorithms as objects
        - b) how to describe class and objects that results from a inflexible design
    - there may list of conditions to  *checklist* before a particular design pattern can be used
  - solultion
    - describes the elements that make up the design pattern solution (how the elements are related, responsibilities of each element,
    and how do elements collaborate)
    - a design pattern doesn't try to follow a partiular implementation or concrete design because
    they can be applied in many different situatinons
    - namely, pattern describes an abstract description of a problem and shows a general way of solving them
  - consequence
    - this is normally trade-offs of applying such pattern
    - tradeoffs often include questions like: is it flexible? is it extensible? portable?
    
<h3> Types of design patterns (Gang of Four; defines 23 design pattern) </h3>

- 3 types of design patterns
  - creation pattern
  - structural pattern
  - behavioral pattern
  
- creational pattern
  - creates objects for you, rather than having you instantiate objects directly
  - gives you flexibility in deciding when the object should be created
- structural pattern
  - used to compose group of objects into larger structure
  - used for creating complex UI
- behavioural pattern
  - help you define communication between objects in your systems and how the flow is controlled in complex program
