<h1> Structural Pattern </h1>

- Describe how objects and classes can be combined to form larger structures
- What is the difference between class pattern and object pattern?
  - class pattern - describes inheritance and how it can be used to provide more useful program interface
  - object pattern - describes composition (object composed to create larger structures)

<h5> Examples of Structural patterns are: </h5>

- adaptor - allow client class to another class that may provie service to it (namely, incompatible API)
  - benefits?
- composite 
- facade - make single class represent an entire subsystem
  - benefits?
- bridge
- decorator - add additional feature to objects dynamically
  - benefits?
- flyweight - sharing objects, where each object stores its state externally
  - benefits?
